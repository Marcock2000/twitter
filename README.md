# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# What is this?

A website to share music.


# Coming Soon:

* A system to add friends / Only see posts from friends
* A more friendly auth system LOL right now it only works with GitHub accounts, will probably change to Gmail or something.
*A more efficient way to interact with spotify's API, i'm sure there's better ways as this was some caveman approach that just happened to work the first time. 

*  F*ck around and find out!
